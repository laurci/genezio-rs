# genezio-rs

Get Rust running on [Genezio](https://genez.io) as a backend language.

## Getting started!

First, you will need Rust installed :) We will use both `cargo` and `rustup` in the next steps, so I recommend installing Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). If you have it installed, skip this step.

Next, we will need the `genezio-rs` CLI from this repo. You can install it using `cargo`:
```
cargo install --git http://github.com/laurci/genezio-rs.git cli
```

Now, just run `genezio-rs doctor` and see what it says. If everything is fine, you can start a new project using `genezio-rs new my-project` and start coding! If you have errors, don't worry, just continue reading this section.
